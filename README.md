# fusion

This repository holds the code necessary to run the shielded grid fusion system.

The current code for the controllino is in the v2/pulse directory.

Previous controllino code (using a text-string command set instead of nslc) lives in the v1 directory.

IRC bots for interfacing with hardware live in the control/ subdirectory.
